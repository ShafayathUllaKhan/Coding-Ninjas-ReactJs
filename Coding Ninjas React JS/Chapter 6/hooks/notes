problems with using class based components?

Hard to reuse the stateful logic between components
complex components become difficult to understand
classes can be confusing at times 


useState
useEffect = for side effects acts like cdm and cdu


Step	What Happens
Mount	Effect runs, sets up timer
Update	🔁 Cleanup from previous effect runs → then new setInterval is created
Unmount	Only the cleanup runs

✅ So yes — on update, the return function runs first, and then the effect body is executed again.

This behavior ensures that:

Old intervals/subscriptions are cleaned up properly before new ones are set up.

You never end up with multiple overlapping timers or subscriptions.
